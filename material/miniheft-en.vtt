00:01.000 --> 00:07.000  line:75%
For these mini-zines you only need
a sheet of paper and scissors.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000 line:75%
Fold the paper in half, …

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000 line:75%
then again …

00:28.500 --> 00:31.500 line:75%
and once more.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000 line:75%
Crease it well.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000 line:75%
Now reopen the last two folds.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000 line:75%
It’s time for a cut, namely
on the closed edge

00:50.200 --> 00:55.000 line:75%
along the central folding line
up to the middle.

00:57.500 --> 01:05.500 line:75%
Like this! Finally open the paper,

01:02.000 --> 01:05.500 line:75%
fold it lengthwise

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000 line:75%
and squeeze it in form.

01:20.500 --> 01:23.000 line:75%
Crimp over the booklet …

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000 line:75%
and your mini-zine is done!
