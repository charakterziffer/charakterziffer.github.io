<h1>Testpage for OpenType Features</h1>
<p>On this page I use my webfont <i>Otfeat</i>. It’s an icon font designed for testing OpenType features. For example:</p>
<p><img class="floating" src="sc-off.png" alt="smcp OFF" title="smcp OFF">OFF – The box is empty/white. That’s the initial situation and shows: The feature (here: <i>smcp</i>, small capitals) is either turned off or your browser isn’t able to display this feature.</p>
<p><img class="floating" src="sc-on.png" alt="smcp ON" title="smcp ON">ON – After activation the box becomes filled/black. The feature <i>smcp</i> (small capitals) is turned on and your browser is able to show it.</p>
<p><i>[In meinem Blog gibt’s einen kurzen <a href="../otfeat.html">Überblick zu Otfeat</a> auch in Deutsch.]</i><br>
<a id="top" href="#about">↓&nbsp;More about OpenType features.</a><br>
&nbsp;</p>


<h2>1) OpenType features switched on</h2>
<p>Here you can see which OpenType features are supported by your
browser. They are switched on by CSS (the two boxes with an X are not
yet associated with a feature):</p>
<p class="otfeat allon">abcdefghijklm<br>
nopqrstuvwxyz<br>
ABCDEFGHIJ<br>
KLMNOPQRSTUVWZ</p>
<p>Here’s an image how it should look like (colored green for better destinction between the real test and the screenshot):</p>
<p style="margin-top:1.4em"><img src="otfeat-allon.png" title="The letters of Otfeat with activated OpenType features" alt="The letters of Otfeat with activated OpenType features"></p>

<h2>2) All features deactivated</h2>
<p>The same text as above but this time the OpenType features are turned off:</p>
<p class="otfeat alloff">abcdefghijklm<br>
nopqrstuvwxyz<br>
ABCDEFGHIJ<br>
KLMNOPQRSTUVWZ</p>
<p>If it doesn’t look like the following image your browser ignores the deactivation of OpenType features:</p>
<p style="margin-top:1.4em;"><img src="otfeat-alloff.png" title="The letters of Otfeat without OpenType features" alt="The letters of Otfeat without OpenType features"></p>

<h2>3) No features explicitly de-/activated</h2>
<p>That’s the default status in your browser:</p>
<p class="otfeat">abcdefghijklm<br>
nopqrstuvwxyz<br>
ABCDEFGHIJ<br>
KLMNOPQRSTUVWZ</p>
<p>In some browsers individual OpenType features are activated by
default, so some boxes may be black (e. g. standard ligatures and
kerning in Firefox).</p>

<h2>Some details</h2>
<p>This page was published on June 12th, 2012.</p>
<p>With the <span class="sc">CSS</span>-setting <i>text-rendering: optimizeLegibility</i> it is possible, to activate some OpenType features in Safari (e. g. <i>liga</i> or <i>calt</i>).
 But after some testing I decided not to use this setting. Firstly it
caused some rendering problems in Google’s Chrome (especially at test Nº
 3) and secondly once activated the features couldn’t be deactivated
again (test Nº 2).</p>
<p>The feature <i>locl</i> (localized forms) is programmed with a
default language. So this is no test if browsers are capable of using a
special localized alternative depending on the corresponding language
tag. Maybe I’ll implement this in a future version.</p>
<p>The <i>kernig</i> of Otfeat (more precisely between A and B) is
applyed by individual kerning pairs. Kernig by a matrix of kerning
classes is not tested and could be failing. Again something for a future
 version of Otfeat.</p>
<p>Even if <i>fina</i> seems to be working, it does not necessarely do
what it should. This feature is meant to replace letters only when they
are at the end of a word. In the following example the fina box should
be black only in the third case:</p>
<p class="otfeat allon">Z XZX XXZ</p>
<p>Otfeat’s small letters a–z represent single OpenType features which
could be tested in any order. The capital letters are engaged with
ligatures and context-sensitive features. The easiest thing that they
will be shown correctly is to type the alphabet. At least the following
pairs must be intact: AB, CD, EF, GH, IJ, RST and UVW. The pair KL has
to be followed by an M. M and N depend on each other (in this order) and
 the O needs to follow an N.</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>

<h2>More about OpenType features</h2>
<p>OpenType features are special functions which are programmed into a
font. Examples are small capitals, swash letters or old-style figures.
These functions can be activated in superior office and design programms
 – and as of late also in browsers.</p>
<p>The Microsoft website offers a detailed list with <a href="">common OpenType features</a>. There you also find descriptions for the 4-letter-abbreviations used in Otfeat. At <i>I Love Typography</i> there’s a nice <a href="http://ilovetypography.com/OpenType/opentype-features.html">article with concrete examples</a> how some substitution features look like in practice.</p>
<p>Typotheque published <a href="http://www.typotheque.com/articles/opentype_features_in_web_browsers_-_tests">another test for OpenType features in browsers</a> – but: they get slightly different results than me (e. g. they couldn’t deactivate ligatures in Firefox). Don’t know why …</p>
